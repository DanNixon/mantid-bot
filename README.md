==========

Currently I can:

- Give you the title, status and URL of a Trac ticket when you mention the number in a message (```#XXXX```)
- Tell you the state of a build when you ask for it (e.g. ```!develop_clean```)
- Give you the name of all build jobs using ```!builds```

In the future I want to:

- Inform you when a build has failed or has warnings
- Private message you when there is new activity on one of your assigned tickets
